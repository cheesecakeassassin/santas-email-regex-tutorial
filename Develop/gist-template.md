# Santa's Email Regex Tutorial

Regex or Regular Expressions can look scary to the untrained eye. I for one always ran away from them until I took a closer look and learned that they weren't all so bad! I'd like to take you step-by-step and show you the way of the regex so you won't be frightened next time you see one. Let's get started!

## Summary

There are so many different uses for regex but for this gist I will focus solely on the regex for matching an email. A regex in short is a string of characters that assist in finding patterns in text. It is essential to programming. Here's an example of the email regex we will be discussing:

```
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```
Come along for the ride as we dissect this beast!
